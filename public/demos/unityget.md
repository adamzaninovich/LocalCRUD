Here's a demo of how location querying should work. This is just a prototype and can be changed if you want. This isn't working yet, but I'll let you know when I write the items#nearby action so you can try it out.

This assumes that either Unity already has a JSON parser (I looked through the docs and didn't find one), or you have Douglas Crockford's json2 library loaded.

Here's a minified version of [json2.js](http://localcrud.herokuapp.com/demos/json2.js).

It should go in its own file and be loaded at the beginning of your script.

JSON is a much better transfer format than XML. It's smaller and just all around easier to work with, especially since you're already using javascript.

Ok, given all that, here's how you query a location:

    // declare variables
    var baseURL, distance, httpRequest, location, response;

    // the location part of the query should be formatted like this string
    location  = "35.2821,-120.659";
    distance  = 3; // in miles
    baseURL   = "http://localcrud.herokuapp.com/items";

    // make request
    httpRequest = new WWW(baseURL + "/nearby/" + encodeURIComponent(location) + "/" + encodeURIComponent(distance) + "/miles.json");

    // your url should look something like http://localcrud.herokuapp.com/items/nearby/35.2821%2C-120.659/3/miles.json
    // you can try this in a browser to see what you'll get. It will be something like:
    // 

    // wait for request to complete
    yield httpRequest;

    // check for errors
    if (httpRequest.error === null) {
      // all good parse response
      response = JSON.parse(httpRequest.text);
      // DO STUFF HERE
    } else {
      // not all good, log error
      Debug.Log("HTTP Request Error: " + httpRequest.error);
    }

response will contain a javascript object with some metadata and an array of all the nearby items

    {
      params: { // these are the parameters from your query 
        location: "35.2821,-120.659",
        distance: 3,
        unit:     "miles"
      },
      items: [ // this is an array of items that were found nearby in order of distance
        { // item 0
          name: "first item",
          latlng: [35.2821,-120.659]
          distance: 0.0
        },
        { // item 1
          name: "second item"
          // ...
        }
      ]
    }

You can access these as you normally would with an object.

    response.items[0].latlng[1]
    => -120.659
    response.params.unit
    => "miles"

Hope this helps!
